# fire-outbreaks

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of fire outbreaks throughout Brazil in the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. The visual analysis was developed using the JavaScript language, through the Vega-lite-api library, on the Observable platform.<br/>

From the analysis, areas that require greater attention in the field of environmental preservation were identified. The visual analysis result is available at the following link: https://observablehq.com/d/ab9226678a1358b1. This approach provides a clear and accessible view of fire patterns, supporting efforts for effective strategies for environmental preservation and prevention in critical areas. <br/>
